There are many combinations of discretization type and number of bins that are tested.
The code creates a separate .csv file for each combination for so the results cen be checked.
discretization_optimizer.py doesn't move these files to a diffrent folder but i moved them manually to binning_results folder.
The other folder "basic_binning_process" has diffrent datasets, preprocess codes for those datasets and only one type binning, code. So nothing interesting ;)
